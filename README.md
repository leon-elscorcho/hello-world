# hello-world
the musings of a product managing engineer/actor

in a world that seperates creative and technical I like to find the balance.
using skills and lessons from improv and acting, paired with experience in
numerous engineering disciplines and industries, i try to find the truth and
set my team up to succeed in building it.
